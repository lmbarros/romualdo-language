# The Romualdo Language

A programming language for Interactive Storytelling.

Probably should look more like a domain-specific language than a general-purpose
language, but since I don't know the domain well it will probably lean too much
to the general-purpose side. Romualdo 2.0 will probably look considerably
different.
