# The Romualdo Language

A programming language for Interactive Storytelling.

Probably should look more like a domain-specific language than a general-purpose
language, but since I don't know the domain well it will probably lean too much
to the general-purpose side. Romualdo 2.0 will probably look considerably
different.

## Credits

* The Romualdo Language syntax is in no small extent inspired by
  [Lua](http://www.lua.org).
* The implementation of the compiler and virtual machine are strongly based on
  Bob Nystrom's excellent [Crafting
  Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com). And maybe this is an
  understatement.
